                <p>Welcome to the Shipping & Delivery Policy for Launchshop.in. This document explains the processing, shipping, and delivery guidelines for products and services obtained on our platform.</p>
                
                <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2" style="font-weight: 700; color: #1e293b;">1. Platform Nature (SaaS Platform)</h4>
                <p>Launchshop.in is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) provider. We provide ecommerce storefront software, custom domain setups, and related hosting services. There are no physical goods shipped directly by Launchshop.in to our platform subscribers.</p>
                
                <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2" style="font-weight: 700; color: #1e293b;">2. Digital Delivery & Setup Timeline</h4>
                <p>Upon a successful purchase of a paid plan, your Launchshop store is provisioned **instantly**. You will receive account access immediately. 
                * **Custom Domains (.in or other extensions):** Submissions for custom domains are initiated immediately. Active registration and propagation can take between **24 to 48 hours** to complete.</p>
                
                <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2" style="font-weight: 700; color: #1e293b;">3. Vendor Store Deliveries (For Customers of Stores Powered by Launchshop)</h4>
                <p>If you are a customer purchasing physical or digital products from an online store **hosted** on Launchshop.in, the delivery timeline, shipping charges, carrier options, and tracking details are managed **solely by the respective store owner (vendor)**. Launchshop.in does not handle shipping operations or package fulfillment for individual store orders.</p>
